# Picot

## Product

**Picot** is a local desktop GUI for the Pi coding agent. It is a Tauri app that bundles its own `pi` runtime — there is no separate install of `pi` to manage.

### Architecture

Tauri wraps the web UI. A Rust `PiManager` (`src-tauri/src/pi_manager.rs`) spawns one `pi --mode rpc` subprocess per workspace, each on its own port, using the embedded pi binary shipped in `src-tauri/resources/pi/` (downloaded by `scripts/fetch-pi-binary.js` from pi-mono releases at the version pinned in `scripts/pi-version.json`). Each workspace gets its own OS window. Workspaces are opened via the native folder picker ("Open Folder"); clicking it opens or focuses a workspace window. Multi-project, multi-agent, no terminal required.

```
Picot .app
  resources/
    public/                       (frontend)
    extensions/embedded-server.mjs (HTTP + WS server, runs inside pi)
    pi/<bun-compiled pi binary + assets>
  Rust PiManager
    spawn pi --mode rpc --extension embedded-server.mjs  (project A, :3001)
    spawn pi --mode rpc --extension embedded-server.mjs  (project B, :3002)
    OS Window per project  →  WebView  →  localhost:300X
  Tauri IPC commands wired through public/tauri-bridge.js
```

Tauri IPC commands (invoked via `window.tauriNative` in `public/tauri-bridge.js`):
- `cmd_open_workspace(cwd)` — spawn pi for a workspace, open a window
- `cmd_new_session(port)` — create a new session in a running pi
- `cmd_switch_session(port, sessionPath)` — resume a historical session
- `cmd_stop_instance(port)` — kill a pi process
- `cmd_pick_folder()` — native folder picker

### Goals

- Local desktop GUI: all projects and agents visible in one app
- Multi-project: each project has its own window, isolated working directory, session history, and running agent
- Multi-agent: spawn new agents per project; switch between sessions without leaving the app
- Multi-task: a `pi --mode rpc` process can only drive **one active session at a time** (switching/forking inside one process *replaces* the active session — the old `.jsonl` is preserved on disk, but it stops being the live, running session). So every concurrently-running session structurally needs its own `pi` process. Picot handles this without spawning OS windows: both "+ New Session" (header) and "start new chat" (sidebar project tile) spawn a fresh **headless** pi for the target cwd and navigate the current window's WebView to it. The previously-attached pi process keeps running in the background (PiManager retains it; reachable from the running-instances list / launcher / sidebar). Net effect: no new OS window, no interruption of the previously-running session, and you can still run multiple agents in parallel against the same project.
- Visualization: streaming chat, tool-call cards, thinking blocks, token/cost tracking per session
- Fully self-contained desktop app: zero dependency on the user's PATH / shell environment / globally installed pi

### Constraints

- Frontend: vanilla JS, no framework (`public/`)
- Backend: Rust (Tauri) wraps + manages process lifecycle; Node.js extension (`embedded-server.ts`) implements the HTTP + WS surface the WebView talks to
- PI integration: always via embedded `pi --mode rpc` subprocess — never re-implement PI runtime logic
- Session history and working directory are isolated per project/port
- The embedded pi version is the source of truth: `pi --version` shown in the UI comes from `PI_STUDIO_PI_VERSION` (set by Rust at spawn time, populated from `scripts/pi-version.json`). A user-installed pi on `$PATH` is irrelevant and never touched.
- User extensions under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` and `<workspace>/.pi/extensions/` are still auto-loaded by the embedded pi (embedding doesn't disable user extensions).

### PI references

- RPC protocol: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent/docs/rpc.md`
- SDK: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent/docs/sdk.md`
- Session format: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent/docs/session.md`
- JSON mode: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent/docs/json.md`

# Agent working notes

Conventions for any coding agent working in this directory.

## Package manager

Use **Bun** exclusively. Never run `npm install` or `npm ci` — this would create a stray `package-lock.json` that drifts from `bun.lock` and confuses CI (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`).

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile   # install deps
bun run <script>                # run package.json scripts
```

## Common commands

```bash
bun run dev              # fetch embedded pi binary, then start tauri dev (hot reload)
bun run test             # vitest run + check-tauri-permissions
bun run test:watch       # vitest in watch mode
bun run check:rust       # cargo check + clippy + fmt (use after every Rust edit)
bun run fetch:pi         # download the locked pi binary into src-tauri/resources/pi/
bun run build:extensions # compile extensions/embedded-server.ts → dist/embedded-server.mjs
bun run build            # full release build (runs prebuild: fetch:pi + build:extensions)
```

Single test file: `bun run vitest run public/settings-save-status.test.js`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for JS/TS linting and formatting.

After every frontend or extension edit, run the check before declaring the work done:

```bash
bun run check         # lint + format check (read-only, shows violations)
bun run check:fix     # auto-fix all safe issues
bun run lint          # lint only
bun run format        # format check only
bun run format:fix    # auto-fix formatting
```

### Rules

- **Always** run `bun run check` after editing any `.js` / `.ts` file under `public/` or `extensions/`.
- Only mark the task complete if `bun run check` exits 0 (or all remaining violations are intentional and documented).
- Prefer `bun run check:fix` over manual reformatting — Biome is the source of truth for style.

## Module Design

The frontend (`public/`) is vanilla JS with **no framework**. Keep it modular:

- **One concern per file.** Each module owns a single responsibility (e.g. WebSocket client, session sidebar, file browser, theme switching). Do not add unrelated logic to an existing file just because it is convenient.
- **Avoid growing `app.js`.** `app.js` is the entry point / orchestrator. New feature logic belongs in a dedicated module that `app.js` imports, not inline in `app.js` itself.
- **New file threshold.** If a feature adds more than ~50 lines of logic, extract it into its own module (e.g. `public/my-feature.js`) and import it from the appropriate entry point.
- **No shared-state side-effects at import time.** Modules should export functions/classes; side-effects that mutate global state should be triggered explicitly by the caller, not at module load.
- **Security/path/i18n changes require the full test suite.** Run `bun run test` before declaring work complete when touching loopback access, filesystem paths, static assets, or locale coverage; the focused regression tests are listed under `## Tests`.
- **Naming.** Use kebab-case filenames that match the single responsibility (`session-sidebar.js`, `file-browser.js`, `workspace-actions.js`).

## Architecture authority

[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the authoritative source for product
architecture, feature invariants, lifecycle rules, security boundaries, and
feature-specific validation. Before changing any UI behavior, persistence,
workspace I/O, or cross-process communication, read the applicable architecture
section and the design documents it links. Do not duplicate those detailed
contracts in this guide.

When changing the LAN boundary, cross-platform path handling, or static-asset
serving shape, also update the `## 边界与不变量` and file-browsing security
sections in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Architecture map

[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the canonical map of the Rust host,
embedded server, vanilla-JS frontend, transport paths, startup sequence,
persistence model, and feature ownership. Read it before selecting a module or
adding a new communication path.

This guide intentionally keeps only repository-wide operating rules. Put
feature-specific invariants, module indexes, and design links in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, then update that document whenever the implementation
materially changes.

For Quick Chat or Side Chat changes, read the corresponding
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-quick-and-side-chat-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-quick-and-side-chat-design.md)
and the temporary-chat section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` before choosing an entry
point, transport path, or lifecycle behavior.

## Cross-boundary and prototype verification

Before changing a browser/server adapter, a popup/overlay, or shared-state
rerender behavior, read and apply
[`docs/engineering-lessons.md`](docs/engineering-lessons.md). Its applicable
rules are mandatory release criteria; do not treat a visual prototype as
non-binding inspiration or assume a Node HTTP object when the production path
uses Bun's Fetch adapter.

## Bumping the embedded pi version

1. Edit `scripts/pi-version.json` → `version`.
2. `bun run fetch:pi` (re-downloads the platform tarball, replaces `src-tauri/resources/pi/`).
3. Smoke test: `./src-tauri/resources/pi/pi --version` and `bun run dev`.
4. Commit `scripts/pi-version.json`. Do **not** commit `src-tauri/resources/pi/`; it is gitignored.

## Embedded pi: how it ends up inside the .app

End users never run `fetch:pi`. The flow that puts `pi` inside the shipped bundle is:

1. **Pre-build hook.** `package.json` `prebuild` runs `bun run fetch:pi` before `tauri build`. Downloads the platform tarball into `src-tauri/resources/pi/` (idempotent; skipped if `.version` matches). Bun honors npm-style `pre*` / `post*` lifecycle hooks for `bun run`.
2. **Tauri before-hooks.** `tauri.conf.json` `build.beforeBuildCommand` and `build.beforeDevCommand` BOTH run `bun run fetch:pi` first, so even invoking `tauri build` / `tauri dev` directly (no `bun run build`) still guarantees the binary is present.
3. **Tauri bundling.** `tauri.conf.json` `bundle.resources` maps `./resources/pi` → `pi`, so the entire pi runtime tree is copied into `<App>.app/Contents/Resources/pi/` at package time.
4. **Last-line guard (build.rs).** `src-tauri/build.rs` PANICS at compile time if `resources/pi/<bin>` is missing in a release profile. This prevents `cargo build --release` (or any IDE that bypasses bun) from silently producing a .app with no pi inside. Override only for local experiments via `PI_STUDIO_SKIP_BIN_CHECK=1`.

Net effect: there is no path that ships a Picot release without the embedded pi binary. End users get a self-contained app — no PATH lookups, no `bun run fetch:pi`, no manual install of pi.

## Post-fix verification (Rust / Tauri)

After every edit under `src-tauri/` (or any Rust fix), run the lint+check script before declaring the work done. It catches compile-time errors (e.g. `E0282`, `E0061`, Tauri v1→v2 API drift, deprecated APIs) without producing a binary, so it is much faster than `tauri build`.

```bash
bun run check:rust
# or directly
bash scripts/check-rust.sh
```

`scripts/check-rust.sh` runs, in order:

1. `cargo check --all-targets` — type/borrow/API signature check (~1–5s).
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — lints, warnings as errors.
3. `cargo fmt --check` — advisory only; prints a hint if formatting drifts, but does not fail the script.

### Rules

- **Never** run `tauri build` / `cargo build` just to verify a fix — use `bun run check:rust` instead. Per project policy, full builds are not used for verification.
- After editing any `*.rs` file under `src-tauri/`, run `bun run check:rust` and only mark the task complete if it exits 0.
- When upgrading Tauri or its plugins, run the script first to surface any deprecation warnings before touching feature code.

## Auto-updater

Picot uses the Tauri v2 updater plugin to fetch new releases from GitHub. The runtime side lives in `public/tauri-bridge.js` + `public/app.js` (Settings → General → Updates), and the build side is wired into `.github/workflows/release.yml` via the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` / `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets. See `docs/AUTO_UPDATER.md` for the one-time signing-key setup and how `latest.json` flows from CI → GitHub release → installed app.

## Tests

Vitest tests live beside their modules in `public/` (`*.test.js`) and
`extensions/` (`*.test.ts`) under the jsdom/Vitest environment. The full
`bun run test` also runs `scripts/check-tauri-permissions.js` to validate Tauri
capability permissions.

Security and cross-platform regression coverage includes:

- `extensions/request-access.test.ts` — loopback-only HTTP/WS policy.
- `extensions/path-safety.test.ts` — filesystem containment and sibling-prefix escapes.
- `extensions/open-path.test.ts` — platform-specific system opener selection.
- `public/workspace/path-utils.test.js` — POSIX, Windows drive, and UNC paths.
- `public/super-agent/navigation.test.js` — Super Agent navigation successor.
- `public/i18n-keys-completeness.test.js` — locale parity and missing-file failures;
  it must not silently skip when a locale file is absent.

After changing Rust, run `bun run check:rust`. After changing frontend or
extension code, run `bun run check`; after changes to the embedded server, also
run `bun run build:extensions`.

## Security boundaries

The embedded server keeps LAN access intentionally read-only. Static assets and
approved read-only REST endpoints may be available to LAN/mobile clients, but
`/ws`, `/api/rpc`, file writes, system/workspace/session controls, configuration,
Telegram, Super Agent controls, and picker-scope directory enumeration are
loopback-only. CORS is not authentication. The single source of truth is
`extensions/request-access.ts`, which checks the socket peer address and fails
closed when a controlled request has no peer address. Both Node and Bun adapter
paths must use the same policy. Mobile control flows through the authenticated
broker rather than bypassing this boundary.

Filesystem containment belongs to `extensions/path-safety.ts`; static serving
must validate both the resolved candidate and its `realpath` so traversal,
sibling-prefix, and symlink escapes are rejected. The design contract is
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-complete-merge-fixes-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-complete-merge-fixes-design.md).

## Cross-platform paths

Frontend path handling is platform-neutral and must use
`public/workspace/path-utils.js` for POSIX, Windows drive, and UNC strings;
do not use browser-host OS APIs or hard-code `/` splitting in feature modules.
System opening is centralized in `extensions/open-path.ts` and selects
`open`, `explorer.exe`, or `xdg-open` without shell concatenation. Static assets
are served by `extensions/embedded-server.ts` with the realpath containment
checks from `extensions/path-safety.ts`. The Rust super-agent workspace lookup
uses `PathBuf::join` and HOME/USERPROFILE/HOMEDRIVE+HOMEPATH fallbacks. See the
same complete-merge-fixes design spec before changing these boundaries.
